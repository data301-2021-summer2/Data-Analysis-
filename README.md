## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words
As someone who enjoys indulging in fast food, fine dining, and comfort food, I have always had this thought 
at the back of my head whether the food I'm eating is hygienically prepared, safe to consume, and so on. The 
fear of falling sick from the consumption of food items in particular circumstances (street food in particular) 
has narrowed my options and limited my ability to try different dishes. Finding whether certain aspects of food, 
location, or type have a direct correlation with a greater probability of contracting any illness will help us 
take appropriate precautions and safety measures and will thus reduce the overall hospital visits or fatalities 
faced by the world. It will also simultaneously help cooks eliminate any chances of causing any outbreaks caused 
by the consumption of their prepared dishes. Lastly, it will also help me ease my mind the next time I am eating 
at a local chain or stalls or food trucks.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

This dataset provides data on the occurence of food borne illnesses happening in different US states, day, month, 
year (2015 only), and the type of contamination. The purposes of undertaking this project are an inter twinning 
combination of fun, learning, personal interest/curiosity, and public awareness.
