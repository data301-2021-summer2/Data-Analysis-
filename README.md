## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words
As someone who enjoys indulging in fast food, fine dining, and comfort food, I have always had this thought 
at the back of my head whether the food I'm eating is hygienically prepared, safe to consume, and so on. The 
fear of falling sick from the consumption of food items in particular circumstances (street food in particular) 
has narrowed my options and limited my ability to try different dishes. Finding whether certain aspects of food, 
location, or type have a direct correlation with a greater probability of contracting any illness will help us 
take appropriate precautions and safety measures and will thus reduce the overall hospital visits or fatalities 
faced by the world. It will also simultaneously help cooks eliminate any chances of causing any outbreaks caused 
by the consumption of their prepared dishes. Lastly, it will also help me ease my mind the next time I am eating 
at a local chain or stalls or food trucks.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

The uploaded dataset is provided by the CDC (Center for Disease Control and Prevention) which, is the national public 
health agency of the United States. It contains data on the occurrence of food-borne illnesses happening in different 
US states, day, month, year, and the type of contamination, along with the fatality rate and other statistical measures. 
Although the data was collected from the year 1998 up till 2015, I have only considered data entries that do not have any null/missing values in the columns. 
This measure was exercised to reduce the overall number of data entries and give a better and more conclusive result. 
The purpose of the given data set is accountability and public awareness. By performing further analysis and tests, I would 
like to inspect if any trends occur within the given data set or not. Finally, the data was collected primarily by humans 
working in health agencies across the US and reporting the data CDC.
